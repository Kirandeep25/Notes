5. Add, edit, and delete cells (markdown or code)
6. Execute JavaScript code directly in code cells
7. Switch between Scroll and Side-by-Side view modes in Settings

## View Modes

- **Scroll View**: Cells are displayed vertically, one after another. This is the traditional notebook layout.
- **Side-by-Side View**: Cells are displayed in a grid layout, creating a notebook-like experience with multiple cells visible at once.

## Future Features

- **Mobile View**: Responsive design optimized for smartphones and tablets, with touch-friendly controls and a simplified interface for smaller screens.

- **Different Notebook Styles**: Additional notebook templates and themes including academic, coding, scientific, and presentation-focused layouts.

- **Stylus Integration**: Support for stylus input on devices like Surface Pro and iPad, enabling handwritten notes, sketches, and mathematical equations.

- **Real-time Cursors**: See where other collaborators are working with colored cursors representing each user.

- **Offline Mode**: Work without internet connection and sync changes when reconnected.

- **Version History**: Browse and restore previous versions of notebooks.

- **Rich Media Support**: Embed images, videos, and interactive visualizations within notebooks.

- **Custom Themes**: Create and share custom color schemes and visual styles.

- **Export Options**: Additional export formats including PDF, standalone HTML, and plain text.

- **Template Library**: Pre-built notebook templates for common use cases.

## Development

To run the server and client separately:

- Server only: `npm run server`
- Client only: `npm run client`
- Development mode with auto-reload: `npm run dev`

## Data Storage

Notebooks are stored as JSON files in the `data/notebooks` directory. Each notebook has its own file with a UUID filename.
